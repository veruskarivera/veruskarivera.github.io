        <i>"<strong>Re-entry Anxiety</strong>: fear about re-entering society and leaving quarantine behind.”</i><br><br>
        COVID-19 changed our lives in unexpected ways and since the lockdown restrictions<br> are beginning to be lifted, Americans are experiencing <strong>re-entry anxiety</strong> as they attempt <br>to resume regular activities and many don’t know where or how to start.

        <p class="stepDescription">
            One of the solutions to overcome anxiety is to focus on the things we can control.<br>
            Check-In, a reservation app, allows users to know what their preferred businesses are <br>
            doing to commit to CDC guidelines. It tracks real-time and expected occupancy. This will<br> 
            not only help to avoid awkward situations but, help to gain the sense of control lost due <br>
            to the uncertainty of the pandemic.

              salon was taking before booking my appointment.<br> 
              It gave me peace of mind knowing what to expect <br>

        <p class="stepDescription">This project from start to finish was so much fun to do, but it was also really
          challenging<br> because it was our first 
          online semester due to the pandemic. Since we didn’t have a<br> physical meeting time, things got a little
          complicated 
          but we were able to overcome the <br>communication challenge and we created this amazing product.
          I also learned a 
          lot about<br> myself, I was co-managing the project and I never thought I had that leadership skill within<br>
          me until all
          my peers complimented it at the end of the project.
