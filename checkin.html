          Re-entry Anxiety: fear about re-entering society and leaving quarantine behind

          <br>
          COVID-19 changed our lives in unexpected ways and since the lockdown restrictions are getting lifted, <br>
          Americans are experiencing re-entry anxiety as they attempt to resume regular activities and many <br>
          don’t know where or how to start.

        <p class="stepDescription">One of the solutions to overcome anxiety is to focus on the things we can control.
          Check-In, a <br>
          reservation app, will allow users to know what their preferred business is doing to commit to <br>
          CDC guidelines and track real-time and expected occupancy. These will not only help them avoid<br>
          awkward situations but will also help them gain the sense of control they lost due to the uncertainty <br>
          of the pandemic.

                <p class="stepDescription">This project from start to finish was so much fun to do, but it was also really challenging because it was our first <br>
                  online semester due to the pandemic. Since we didn’t have a physical meeting time, things got a little complicated <br>
                  but we were able to overcome the communication challenge and we created this amazing thing.
                   I also learned a <br>
                   lot about myself, I was co-managing the project and I never thought I had that leadership skill within me until all<br>
                    my peers complimented it at the end of the project.
